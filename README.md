# Sound-Effect-Generator
Classes to generate different "8-bit" sound effects.

The idea is to generate sound effects during the execution of the program using algorithms, instead of recurring to pre-recorded ones.
With this I can have smallest programs and procedurally generate sounds as I need them.
